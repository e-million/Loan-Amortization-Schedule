Everything was spot on, except you forgot your screen shot of your console output, and there was no validation on your inputs. I was able to enter negative numbers for input, which is invalid for an amortization  program, as there's no negative time periods, loans, or interest rates.

I'm only going to take 12 points off for the screen shot, this time. That's an easy 25 points - don't lose them next time! -10 points for the lack of validation methods.

Otherwise, good job!
